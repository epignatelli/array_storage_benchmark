Array storage benchmark
---------------------------------------

Compare the storage speed, retrieval speed and file size for various methods of storing 2D numpy arrays.

Hardware etc
---------------------------------------

The results here are obtained on a normal desktop PC that's several years old and running Ubuntu and has a SSD for storage. You can easily run the benchmarks on your own PC to get more relevant results. You can also apply it to your own data.

Results
---------------------------------------

Dense random matrix
=======================================

Sparse random matrix
=======================================

99% of values are zero, so compression ratios are very good.

Real data
=======================================

Scattering probabilities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide (many doubles between 0 and 1, most close to 0).
